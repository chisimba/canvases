Hi

Here is a zip including a html of live code.

 

We have styled as far as we can.  There a few areas that are being overridden by one of the style sheets and/or jquery which makes the following non-functional / un-stylable

·         The Most Section tabs

o   We will require the full live site including Jquery UI, all external imported stylesheets on our environment to continue.

·         In the item boxes as agreed we were not to change the html.  We have sliced the images required for you to implement in your code.

o   itembloc_favor_star.jpg

o   itembloc_print.jpg

·         You need to use the Jquery to stylise the select dropdowns etc.  You must use the Jquery UI that you are using currently

 

The menu has been re-written as it was being overridden by one of the style sheets and/or jquery code.

 

You will find the following files that have been edited

·         testing.html

·         skins/oer/stylesheet.css

·         skins/oer/oer.css

 

The following folder has been added

·         skins/oer/images/template_resources/

 

To find changes to the code, please search for tags  or comment blocks titled template_thoughtcorp_edit.

 

We have also included comments in the html and commented out the bread crumb as it is not used.

 

This should be decent enough for your presentation on Monday. Happy coding tomorrow. J

 

               

Kind regards,
Rustum Tavaria
