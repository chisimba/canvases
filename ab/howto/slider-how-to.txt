The slider used in this skin is Camera by Pixedelic.com

Introduction,

Camera slideshow is an open source project, based on Diapo 
slideshow (http://www.pixedelic.com/plugins/diapo), but 
improved a lot. You can download it and use for free, you 
can also include it in your projects and sell it as part 
of a bigger work (in this case please consider a donation).

Camera slideshow requires jQuery 1.4+ and other jQuery plugins 
are necessary if you want to use some functionalities: 
jQuery Easing (visit the project page) and a customized version 
of jQuery Mobile (visit the project page) to use Camera with 
mobile devices. These plugins are included in the zip you can 
download at the bottom of this page.


The basics

This is the basic structure to make Camera work:

<div class="camera_wrap">
    <div data-src="images/image_1.jpg"></div>
    <div data-src="images/image_1.jpg"></div>
    <div data-src="images/image_2.jpg"></div>
</div>

Just put this code into your HTML page and the basic slideshow 
will be ready to use. See the other demos to create more complex 
slideshows.

For jQuery newbies: after downloading and unzipping Camera, you 
can see some files in the folder called Examples included in the 
zip: there I provided some examples of Camera slideshow.

As you can see in the examples themselves, before the Camera 
plugin, you must call jQuery in the head of your document: without 
jQuery the slideshow doesn't work.

Then you must call jQuery Easing plugin and jQuery Mobile plugin. 
After that you must call Camera plugin and initialize the 
function camera with the simply method 

jQuery('YOUR_TARGET').camera();

Methods

This is the main function to start your slideshow. Have a look to 
the options for more detailed info about how to set the slideshow.

jQuery('YOUR_TARGET').camera(); //the basic method

jQuery('YOUR_TARGET').camera({ //here I declared some settings, the height and the presence of the thumbnails 
	height: '41%',
	pagination: false,
	thumbnails: true
});


You can use the public methods below to stop the slideshow, for instance, when you open a lightbox. They simply add or remove a class to the target element.

jQuery('YOUR_TARGET').cameraStop(); //stop the slideshow

jQuery('YOUR_TARGET').cameraPlay(); //start the slideshow

jQuery('YOUR_TARGET').cameraPause(); //pause the slideshow (some difference between 'pause' and 'stop': when you stop the loader and the commands are hidden)

jQuery('YOUR_TARGET').cameraResume(); //resume the slideshow after pausing


Skins

Do not forget to call also "camera.css". By editing this CSS file you 
can create your own personal skin, of course. But Camera already 
provides some skins. It has got 33 different colors for the icons. 
To use them just add one of this classes to the target element (if 
you don't use any of this classes the color of the icons will 
be petroleum/graphite):

camera_amber_skin  |  camera_ash_skin  |  camera_azure_skin  
|  camera_beige_skin  |  camera_black_skin  |  camera_blue_skin  
|  camera_brown_skin  |  camera_burgundy_skin  |  camera_charcoal_skin  
|  camera_chocolate_skin  |  camera_coffee_skin  |  camera_cyan_skin  
|  camera_fuchsia_skin  |  camera_gold_skin  |  camera_green_skin  
|  camera_grey_skin  |  camera_indigo_skin  |  camera_khaki_skin  
|  camera_lime_skin  |  camera_magenta_skin  |  camera_maroon_skin  
|  camera_orange_skin  |  camera_olive_skin  |  camera_pink_skin  
|  camera_pistachio_skin  |  camera_pink_skin  |  camera_red_skin  
|  camera_tangerine_skin  |  camera_turquoise_skin
